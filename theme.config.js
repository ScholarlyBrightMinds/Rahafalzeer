        long:  "I'm finishing my Master's in Drug Discovery &amp; Development, and honestly this journey has taught me as much about resilience as it has about science. The failed trials, the repeated experiments, the unexpected readings — and those small moments where everything finally starts to make sense. Alhamdulillah for every one of them. My research sits at the intersection of molecular pharmacology, drug repurposing, and nanomedicine. I'm also a proud AACR member and I lead the student mentorship programme at GMU's Student Happiness Centre. I'm actively seeking PhD opportunities at the interface of molecular pharmacology, targeted drug delivery, and cancer biology."

I also design assessments and provide individual student mentoring.",
