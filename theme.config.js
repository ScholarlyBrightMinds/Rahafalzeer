                    "I trained as a pharmacist, five years at Dubai Medical University covering medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, formulation, and a very long pharmacology lab block. Most of that time I assumed I would end up dispensing or in industry. The shift happened during a research training visit to Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan, where Dr. <strong>Mohammad Alwahsh</strong> introduced me to qPCR, RNA extraction, and the discipline of running cell-culture experiments where the controls actually matter.",

                    "My MSc thesis at Gulf Medical University, in the Drug Discovery and Development programme, investigates the repurposing of <em>Aprocitentan</em> as a potential anticancer agent. Aprocitentan is a licensed dual endothelin receptor antagonist already in clinical use for resistant hypertension. The hypothesis is straightforward and the literature is honest about the gap. Endothelin receptors are well documented in pancreatic and breast cancer biology, but the translational case for blocking them with an already-approved drug has not been worked through carefully.",
                    "The thesis uses in vitro pharmacology to ask that question. MTT and SRB cytotoxicity across pancreatic and breast cancer cell lines, Western blotting for ET-A and ET-B receptor expression and downstream signalling, qPCR for transcriptional readouts, and ELISA where the protein-level question matters. The defence is in July 2026."

                    "<strong>1. Repurposing is a methodological discipline, not a shortcut.</strong> The temptation in a repurposing project is to dose your favourite cell line, watch something die, and call it a hit. That is not science. I spend most of my time on dose-response design, vehicle controls, and reading the receptor-pharmacology literature carefully enough to know what a negative result would even look like.",
                    "<strong>2. Teach what you do.</strong> Since August 2024 I have been a Graduate Teaching Assistant at GMU, running pharmacology lectures and practical sessions in sterile compounding, cell culture, ELISA, Western blotting, qPCR, and MTT. Teaching the same techniques I use in my thesis is the most useful pressure test I have found for whether I actually understand them.",
                    "<strong>3. Work where the molecular and clinical sit next to each other.</strong> My published output so far reads as a mix of bench, formulation, and public-health pharmacy work, and that is by design. I am not interested in research that only lives at one level of resolution."

                    "<strong>Nanomedicine and oral bioavailability.</strong> The pro-bilosome quercetin project at the University of Sharjah is currently under review. It taught me formulation, zeta-sizer characterisation, and how to translate a bench-stable nanocarrier into an oral candidate.",
